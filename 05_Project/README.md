## Restoration of The General/Universal History of the Things of New Spain by Bernardino de Sahagún

## Abstract -
The General/Universal History of the Things of New Spain comprises twelve books by the
Franciscan Fray Bernardino de Sahagún (*1499 - †1590). After being lost for three
centuries, a rediscovered manuscript of this ethnographic research study was named
Florentine Codex after its storage in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence.
Bernardino de Sahagún taught at the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, the first
European school on the American continent after the fall of the Aztec Empire (1519–21).
His students were young men from the Nahua nobility who helped him create a
masterpiece of natural history based on interviews with indigenous informants in
Tlatelolco, Texcoco, and Tenochtitlan. Unfortunately, in 1577, his works were confiscated
by royal order. His research on the Aztec world was considered dangerous for the
Conquest by giving knowledge to the indigenous people. Sadly, when Sahagún died, the
Colegio de Santa Cruz deteriorated. By the 17th century, the rules imposed by the crown
prohibited indigenous people from studying and teaching. There have been some
improvements. But nowadays, there is still a lot to do to save the indigenous heritage.
Since the Spanish conquerors destroyed almost all Aztec manuscripts dating before the
Spanish Conquest, the work of Sahagún is the main and most often the sole source for
studying and understanding central Mexico's civilizations before the Conquest.
Composed of 12 books, it has the special and unique feature of being bilingual.
Sahagún's manuscript was recognized as a World Heritage by UNESCO. And he is called
the father of modern ethnography. Luckily Sahagún had given his promoter Fray Rodrigo
de Sequeira a third copy (usually identified as the "Florentine Codex"), which Sequeira
took to Spain in 1580. The Florentine Codex is the best-preserved manuscript of
Sahagún's piece of work, kept in the Laurentian Library in Florence since 1783.
